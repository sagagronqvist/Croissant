<h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>

    <p>A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named
    for its historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiserie, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is
    layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
    laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>
